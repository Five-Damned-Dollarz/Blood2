	{ "14Gab1.wav",		"We have to go after him.  Who knows what's waiting for him." },
	{ "17Gab1.wav",		"Insect, we are the Ancient One.  Bow down before us." },
	{ "17Gab2.wav",		"You are all that stands between us and dominion?  Pathetic." },
	{ "17Gab3.wav",		"All that is will no longer be.  All that was has never been.  All that was to come... um..." },
	{ "17Gab4.wav",		"All that was to come will never... happen." },
	{ "20Gab1.wav",		"I'm gonna kill you both if you don't shut up." },

	{ "15Gid1.wav",		"Ah, Caleb.  I've been expecting you, you predictable oaf.  I won't be a minute.  I'm just... changING..." },
	{ "15Gid2.wav",		"...into something ...Unpleasant." },
	{ "15Gid3.wav",		"What do you think of my new look?  You have no idea how exquisite pain can feel.  Allow me to demonstrate." },

	{ "16Gid1.wav",		"No!  It's not fair!  I'll kill you!" },
	{ "7Ish1.wav",		"This is a surprising development." },
	{ "7Ish2.wav",		"Having a bad day?" },
	{ "7Ish3.wav",		"Do you understand how much damage your doing?" },
	{ "7Ish4.wav",		"That's not what I mean.  You are the One That Binds.  Sooner or later you'll have to face that." },
	{ "7Ish5.wav",		"Then know this, we are the Chosen.  We're here for you whether you like it or not." },
	{ "7Ish6.wav",		"Yes, Ophelia too.  She was the first to come through." },
	{ "7Ish7.wav",		"I wouldn't miss this for the world.  Then again, you just might end up destroying it." },
	{ "9Ish1.wav",		"You're thinking about Ophelia.  Touching." },
	{ "9Ish2.wav",		"There is a permanent rift in Gideon's temple.  It is a focus for all the damage that is being done.  An epicenter, so to speak.  You will find Ophelia there." },
	{ "9Ish3.wav",		"Tchernobog's destruction opened many doors between the worlds.  They can only be sealed by the One That Binds.  That power lies within you.  This reality will perish unless you restore it." },
	{ "9Ish4.wav",		"There is another reality forcing its way through the rifts, ancient and ravenous.  It is neither good nor evil, it merely is.  But it will devour us all." },
	{ "14Ish1.wav",		"You're not going after him, are you?" },
	{ "14Ish2.wav",		"I'm speculating that it's something very unpleasant." },
	{ "17Ish1.wav",		"Insect, we are the Ancient One.  Bow down before us." },
	{ "17Ish2.wav",		"You are all that stands between us and dominion?  Pathetic." },
	{ "17Ish3.wav",		"All that is will no longer be.  All that was has never been.  All that was to come... um..." },
	{ "17Ish4.wav",		"All that was to come will never... happen." },
	{ "20Ish1.wav",		"It is not over, Caleb.  You must seal the rifts.  You must rebind the fabric of this reality before it tears itself apart." },
	{ "20Ish2.wav",		"The power is within you.  It is time you used it." },
	{ "3MadSci1.wav",	"That's unexpected.  Hmmm, I guess I'll need to recalibrate the singularity settings." },
	{ "7MadSci1.wav",	"Trust me, my calculations are perfect this time." },
	{ "10MadSci1.wav",	"Sir, I have to advise you to reconsider.  My calculations are still inconclusive.  The rifts may be a source of unlimited power, as you suggest, but they might also be deadly pitfalls in the fabric of the space-time continuum.  They might lead you to a realm of pure chaos and evil where you will be completely and utterly annihilated." },
	{ "10MadSci2.wav",	"But sir!" },
	{ "10MadSci3.wav",	"No! ...I never got a chance... to tell you... how much I love you..." },
	{ "12MadSci1.wav",	"Hello, hello, hello.  Welcome to Research and Development, or, as I like to call it... R&D. You may call me... doctor.  I've had some rather interesting subjects lately with all the fluctuations in the cosmic substrate, but I must say I'm especially looking forward to your... dissection.  Please proceed to the main lab and we'll begin the experiment..." },
	{ "11Oph1.wav",		"Prince Charming, I presume." },
	{ "11Oph2.wav",		"Cut me lose and I'll give you a whole vanilla pie." },
	{ "14Oph1.wav",		"He wants you to follow him, you dumb bastard." },
	{ "14Oph2.wav",		"What are we waiting for?" },

	{ "20Oph1.wav",		"You have no choice.  Listen to Ishmael you idiot." },
